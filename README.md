# SIMGlobal

SIMGlobal is an international service application at ITS managed by ITS Global Engagement, commonly known as ITS GE. It aims to help users (Mobility DKG Staff & ITS Students) automate the program registration process, manage registration data, and promote ITS international programs in a more integrated, automated, and extensive manner.

## HiFi Prototype

The SIMGlobal High Fidelity (HiFi) Prototype can be accessed through the following link -> [SIMGlobal HiFi Prototype](https://figma.com/design/mzz8S6sShRV2U0YbOvD8Fc/UI-UX-SIMGlobal?node-id=589-9768&t=uNPUkUA6V6PyPYqc-1)

## Implementation

The creation and testing of the SIMGlobal prototype were carried out using Figma. Figma provides interactive features that enable real-time user flow testing, allowing designs to be developed and tested quickly by users. In addition, we can receive direct and more accurate feedback for feature development. When you open our Figma link, there are two user Points of View (POV) options in the prototype to distinguish business processes according to each user's needs. Users can use the cursor or touch-screen, depending on their device, to try out the prototype in Figma.


## Limitation

- **Editing Form Data**
  The feature to edit previously entered data in the program post or registration form is not available.
- **Real-Time Progress Bar**  
  There is no feature to display real-time status updates for the registration progress bar.
- **Live Chat Communication**  
  There is no "sent" or "seen" status indicator in the Live Chat feature with the chatbot, so user communication tracking is limited.
- **Temporary Data Storage**  
  The application does not support temporary data saving during form completion; users must finish the process in a single session.


## _Wizard of Oz_

Several features in this prototype are not yet implemented or are only partially functional. These simulated features include: logging in with myITS, program search, program registration, registration progress bar, direct message functionality, applicant dashboard, adding programs and registration forms, and displaying messages from applicants. These features are designed to illustrate the intended user experience and workflow, even though the backend processes are not fully integrated at this stage.


## Hard-Coded Features

Currently, the SIMGlobal system does not have a database, so several features use dummy data provided by the development team. The implementation details are as follows:

1. **Dashboard of Programs**  
   Dummy data is used for programs overview on the dashboard.
2. **Registration Program Form**  
   The form uses random data for participant applications.
3. **Dashboard of Participants**  
   Dummy data is used for admin to changes participant registration status.
